# Why?

Since switching the bulk of my programming work from Angular to Vue I was missing a simple to use and lightweight form validation library. I was looking for something similar to Angulars's [`Reactive forms`](https://angular.io/guide/reactive-forms) and [`FormBuilder`](https://angular.io/guide/reactive-forms#using-the-formbuilder-service-to-generate-controls) APIs. After a bit of tinkering, I found that something like this is easily achievable by building on top of Vue's powerful reactivity system. I've been using a private version of this library for most of my projects for a while now. I've decided to clean things up, write some documentation and make it a proper publicly available library.

If this library is not your jam check out one of the other great form validation libraries out there:

- [Vuelidate](https://vuelidate-next.netlify.app/)

- [VeeValidate](https://vee-validate.logaretm.com/v4/)

- [FormKit](https://formkit.com/)
