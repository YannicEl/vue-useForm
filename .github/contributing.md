# `@vuetils/form` Contributing Guide

If you want to fix a bug or add a new feature create a pull request and I will check it out.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Commit messages must follow the [commit message convention](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) so that changelogs can be automatically generated.

## Development Setup

You will need [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)

After cloning the repo, run:

```sh
# install the dependencies of the project
$ pnpm install
```
